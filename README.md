# Assignment1
Used this code to provide a quick test within my file:
/** 
  public static void main(String[]args) {
		AddingMachine test = new AddingMachine();
		test.add(5);
		test.subtract(4);
        test.getTotal();
        System.out.println(test.toString());
	}
*/

Also I removed the package information at the top in order to get my code working outside of Eclipse.
